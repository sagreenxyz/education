## Introduction

My intent with the site is to consolidate information necessary to learn for becoming a fluent web developer (to the extent that the audience becomes "fluent" enough to get by - it takes considerable experience to graduate past fluency to become "proficient."  But, that's another topic.  Originally, my intent was to make this site a learning path that documents what resources are where, and act as a sequential checklist of what path to take.  There is so much content and so many rabbit holes, that staying focused requires some sort of plan - a knowledge-informed plan that can focus the learner on what concepts and skills are essential.  I find myself at this point taking on advanced topics with interest, but needing considerable review of the fundamentals to be proficient enough to tackle the advanced topic at hand.  This website is the tool I intend to develop for that purpose.
